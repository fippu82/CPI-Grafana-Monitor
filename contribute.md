# Contribute

We from Kangoolutions believe that open source makes the world a little bit better. This is why we want everyone to use this pice of software and publish it on a TODO license. We did this before with the CPI-Helper browser plugin and there is now a great community that kills bugs and keeps the product up to date.

You can contribute to this project in various ways:

- Improve documentation
- Tell us your experience
- Add features
- Improve dashboards and the Integration Flow
- much more.

Please get in contact with us via Linkedin/Github issue or send a pull request directly in Github.

In order for us to accept your pull request, please ensure your change is based on the latest version.
